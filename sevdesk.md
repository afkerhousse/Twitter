# Exercise: Build a Data Platform Design 
Objective 
Your task is to design a data platform that extracts data from the sevdesk API, ingests it into a data warehouse, and prepares it for downstream transformation and analytics using dbt. While dbt transformations and the integration with Looker are out of scope, the platform design must account for scalability, monitoring, alerting, and fault tolerance. 
Instructions 
Context 
sevdesk provides an API for accessing accounting and invoicing data. Your data platform must: 
1.	Pull data periodically from the sevdesk API. 
2.	Load the data into a modern data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, or Amazon Redshift). 
3.	Ensure that the ingested data is available for transformations with dbt. 
Deliverables 
1.	System Architecture Diagram 
2.	Technical Design Document: Describe the tools and technologies you would use 
3.	Detail the steps in the pipeline 
4.	Provide examples 
5.	Possible Enhancements
